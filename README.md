# ABAPToTheFuture04
Code Samples from ABAP to the Future Part 04 - I can see ABAP Moon Rising

The release date of the book is 11/23/2021 for people who live in the USA or the Christmas Islands, 23/11/2021 for people in the rest of the world.

In theory all code mentioned in the book is now in this repository. It was written on an ABAP 7.52 system. At a later point I will create another repository for the ABAP in the Cloud (BTP) code. You cannot have one repository for both as the BOPF stuff is not in the BTP ABAP environment and a load of the RAP stuff naturally does not exist in a 7.52 system.

The program Z4_MONSTER_LISTINGS_MAPPING can be used to identify and drill into any specific code listing in the book.
